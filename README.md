Explicit lyrics on Spotify are becoming more and more common on streaming platforms, such as Spotify, people now can filter their preferences and exclude explicit content from their playlists. But when did explicit lyrics actually become a "thing" in the music scene? Is this increase due to new generations of artists? 

The idea behind this project is to investigate whether new and old artists share approximately the same amount of explicit content in their songs or not.

The sample for this project is composed by 4 pillars in the pop-music scene, starting from the 80's till our days. The artists that were selected are: 
 - Prince 80's
 - Madonna 90's
 - Pitbull first 2000 decade
 - Drake second 2000 decade

After getting the credentials, by using the Spotify API, I created data frames for each selected artist. I was interested in getting their audio features and selecting only the years implied for the research. 
First, I decided to analyse artists one by one and after that I created a data frame with all the artists, trying to see if there is an actual correlation between the increase of explicit lyrics and time.
