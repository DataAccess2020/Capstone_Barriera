#HYPOTHESIS ------------------
# The level of explicit content in music has increased over time and 
# especially with new artists. 
# The idea behind this project is to take 4 pillars in the pop-music scene, 
# starting from the 60-70's till our days. The artists that were selected
# are: The Beatles (60-70's), Sting (70-90's), Britney Spears (90's-2010) 
# and Miley Cyrus (2010-2020).

# Getting audio features ----------------

THE_BEATLES <- get_artist_audio_features("The Beatles")
STING <- get_artist_audio_features("STING")
BRITNEY_S <- get_artist_audio_features("Britney Spears")
MILEY_C <- get_artist_audio_features("Miley Cyrus")
